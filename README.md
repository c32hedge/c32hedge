Hi, I’m @c32hedge
- I don't stick emojis in front of everything
- I'm a developer turned software engineer in test
- I'm passionate about elevating the craft of software testing
  - Testing requires just as much skill as software development.
  - Testing requires critical thinking and sense-making that cannot be automated, though automation can assist in good testing.
  - I don't use the term manual testing any more than you would use the term manual programming. Brains matter more than hands.
